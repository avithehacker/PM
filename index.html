                <h1>Welcome to Avinash's Portfolio</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Avinash, a Product Manager based in Bangalore, India, with <span
                        id="experience-counter"></span> of experience in
                    startups and product management. My journey is fueled by a passion for creating impactful products.

                <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m dedicated to crafting products that are intuitive and genuinely make a difference. My approach
                    is always user-first, ensuring that every decision is based on real needs.

                <h2>My Journey & Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    My career began at Veeery, a company focused on empowering visually impaired individuals through
                    better learning tools. This experience shaped my understanding of product management and leadership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2022, I merged Veeery’s as a projects into a non-profit organization, Dharnika, which aims to
                    make education and jobs accessible to people with disabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In July 2022, I embraced a new challenge at Smartivity, leading successful product launches that
                    boosted the company’s growth. By December 2022, I moved to Mahindra, where I took on an even bigger
                    project. At Mahindra, I completely redesigned the EDiig auction platform, modernizing the mobile and
                    desktop sites as well as the Android and iOS apps for a more intuitive user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m proud that with every project I take on, the scope and impact grow larger, pushing me to achieve
                    more and make a greater difference.
                </p>

                <h2>Embracing New Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    I approach every job and business as a unique project, bringing fresh perspectives and innovative
                    solutions. My work with Dharnika, for example, reflects my commitment to social change through
                    technology. Our focus is on inclusive education and employment for people with disabilities. <a
