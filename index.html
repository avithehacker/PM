    <h1>Welcome to Avinash's Portfolio</h1>

    <p>

        Hi, Iâ€™m Avinash, a Product Manager based in Bangalore, India, with over 5 years of experience in startups and product management. My journey is fueled by a passion for creating impactful products.
    </p>

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
        Iâ€™m dedicated to crafting products that are intuitive and genuinely make a difference. My approach is always user-first, ensuring that every decision is based on real needs.
    </p>

    <h2>My Journey & Experience</h2>
    <p>
        My career began at Veeery, a company focused on empowering visually impaired individuals through better learning tools. This experience shaped my understanding of product management and leadership.
<br><br>
In 2022, I merged Veeeryâ€™s as a projects into a non-profit organization, Dharnika, which aims to make education and jobs accessible to people with disabilities.
<br><br>
In July 2022, I embraced a new challenge at Smartivity, leading successful product launches that boosted the companyâ€™s growth. By December 2022, I moved to Mahindra, where I took on an even bigger project. At Mahindra, I completely redesigned the EDiig auction platform, modernizing the mobile and desktop sites as well as the Android and iOS apps for a more intuitive user experience.

<br><br>
Iâ€™m proud that with every project I take on, the scope and impact grow larger, pushing me to achieve more and make a greater difference.

</p>

    <h2>Embracing New Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        I approach every job and business as a unique project, bringing fresh perspectives and innovative solutions. My work with Dharnika, for example, reflects my commitment to social change through technology. Our focus is on inclusive education and employment for people with disabilities.&nbsp;<a href="https://dharnikafoundation.org/">Learn more about Dharnika</a> </p>


    <h2>Why Product Management</h2>
    <p>Understanding user needs and solving complex problems is what I thrive on. Every project is an opportunity to make a positive impact, and thatâ€™s what keeps me going.</p>
