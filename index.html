    <h1>Welcome to Avinash's Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Hey there, I'm Avinash, a dedicated Product Manager based in Bangalore, India. With more than 5 years of experience in startup entrepreneurship and product management, I've honed my skills to create impactful products that make a difference.</p>

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about crafting products that provide seamless experiences and foster positive change in the world. Empathy with users is at the core of my product management philosophy, guiding every decision I make in the development process.
    </p>

    <h2>My Journey & Experience</h2>
    <p>
        My professional journey has been a dynamic and purposeful one. It all began with the founding of Veeery, where I set out to provide seamless learning experiences to visually impaired individuals. This startup not only allowed me to explore entrepreneurship but also fostered my skills in product management and leadership. In 2022, I made the decision to transition Veeery's projects into non-profit initiatives under Dharnika, my NGO, furthering our mission of promoting inclusive education and employment generation for Divyaangjan.
<br><br>
In July 2022, I embarked on a new chapter with Smartivity, where I led successful product launches and played a pivotal role in enhancing user experiences. However, in December 2022, I transitioned to Mahindra to continue driving impactful change in the product management space.
<br><br>
At Mahindra, I've been instrumental in streamlining processes across the used car business, integrating payment solutions, optimizing report management, introducing vendor management platforms, and revamping inventory management systems.
</p>

    <h2>Driving Positive Change</h2>
    <p>A significant part of my heart is dedicated to a social cause pursued through Dharnika, my NGO. Dharnika Foundation focuses on promoting inclusive education and employment generation for Divyaangjan. Leveraging technology, we empower them on a business platform, striving for a more accessible and inclusive society, &nbsp;<a href="https://dharnikafoundation.org/">click here.</a> </p>


    <h2>Why Product Management</h2>
    <p>Understanding the needs and challenges of users allows me to develop solutions that truly resonate and make a difference in their lives. It's not always easy, but the lessons learned along the way are undoubtedly worth it.</p>
