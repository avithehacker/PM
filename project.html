                  <p>
                 This project was for farmers. What usually happen is the farmer 
                 faces heavy losses due to the fraud of pricing and they are forced 
                 to sell their yield at lower price due to lack of knowledge about the
                  ongoing market rates. So, Prixfit was a website that informed farmers 
                  about the current mandi rates, the response of which was quite positive.
